Alphabet Soup Charity Funding Model

This project uses a neural network model to help Alphabet Soup predict which applicants are most likely to successfully use the funding they receive. The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras, with preprocessing done using Pandas and Scikit-learn.
Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to develop a binary classification model that can predict whether an applicant will effectively use the funding provided by Alphabet Soup.
Steps Included:
Data Preprocessing
Dropped unnecessary columns (EIN, NAME).
Encoded categorical variables.
Scaled numerical features using StandardScaler.
Neural Network Model
Created a deep learning model with hidden layers and output layers optimized for binary classification.
Trained and evaluated the model using training and validation data.
Optimized the model with changes in activation functions and added layers for improved accuracy.
Exported the final models to Keras and HDF5 format.
